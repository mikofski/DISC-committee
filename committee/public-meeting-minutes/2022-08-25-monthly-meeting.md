* Hoping to find a time next week (week of Aug 29) or after Sep 6th to start talking about Unconference.  NF Project Summit has been taking priority over past weeks.  Response time from Moore has been a bit slow but understandable based on time of year.  May be if we can write a draft proposal while we wait this would be useful and allow Moore to respond to our suggestions.
