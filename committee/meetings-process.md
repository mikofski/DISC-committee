## Frequency and quorum

- The meetings have been held traditionally every month.
- A simple majority of the committee members shall constitute a quorum.

## Meetings' order of business

1. Call to order and roll call- the chairperson begins the meeting and asks participants to type their name in Slack
2. Adoption of the agenda - when the meeting starts, the chairperson should ask if anyone has additional items to place on the agenda
3. General announcements
4. Approve minutes from previous meeting

  ```md
    RESOLVED, that the DISC Committee approves the minutes at <link> as representing a true and accurate record of the <full date> meeting.
  ```

5. Review new resolutions for discussion
6. New business - items listed under “Discussion items” will be discussed in the order they appear on the agenda at this
   point, no new items can be added to the agenda
7. Adjournment - when the last agenda item is reached, the chairperson should entertain a motion to adjourn the meeting

## How and where we communicate during a meeting

- Slack for voting
- Zoom for conversation
- The Chairperson will share their screen and enforce time limits for items on the agenda

## Communication Norms

- Be mindful of your patterns of communication, for example if you are more prone to speaking out loud actively try to
  make space for others to allow others to have mic time.
- Mute yourself when not speaking.
- If comfortable, use the video option in the meeting.

## Discussions during Committee Meetings

Each item on the agenda should be handled as follows:

- Any consent agenda items
- New business item to be discussed is pasted into the chat window, so everyone knows the topic of discussion.
- The chairperson/vice-chair will initiate discussion with `DISCUSS`. Each member who wishes to speak to the discussions may at any time say `YES`.
  The chairperson will call on each member to speak appropriately. When discussions are over they will be ended by the chairperson
  with either `END DISCUSS` if no vote is required, or `VOTE`.
- If a vote is called then members **have up to one minute** to cast their vote. When all votes are cast or the minute
  has elapsed the chairperson or (more usually) the Secretary will end the vote with the tally

## Voting Procedure during committee Meetings

- Motions can be put to a vote by any committee member. They are normally taken from the agenda.
- If a Committee member wants to discuss a motion before the vote, this is signaled with a `DISCUSS` note to the chat members.
- After discussion, the chairperson or secretary then starts the voting period with a `VOTE`.
  
  ```md
    RESOLVED, that the DISC Committee ... 
  ```
  
  During voting periods no discussions should occur, if possible.
- The voting period ends with `END VOTE` by the chairperson or secretary.
- All votes are counted, and the results displayed immediately for verification by the chat members (`aye-abstain-nay`).

**Example:**

```md
    bm1: RESOLVED, that all board members wear hats, unless it's raining, a Friday, or Easter falls on a Sunday.
    chair: DISCUSS
    bm2: So we never wear hats in a year where Easter falls on a Sunday ?
    bm1: Yes, that's the point.
    chair: Anything else ?
    chair: VOTE
    bm1: Aye
    bm2: Nay
    bm3: Aye
    bm4: Abstain
    chair: Aye
    chair: END VOTE
    secretary: Approved, 3-1-1.
```
