**Agenda**

1. Brief Introductions


2. Goals for the Moore Foundation 2-year DISC grant:
..* production of a scalable kit that can be disseminated to events to help promote best diversity and inclusion practices (including distribution plan)
..* assessment of current diversity programs at NumFOCUS
..* identify best diversity practices and challenges, plus suggestions for new programs
..* creation of initiatives including programs to increase the diversity of project contributors

3. Overview of past NF diversity initiatives
..* Scholarships to PyData, other conferences (SciPy, LSST, AstroPy workshop, etc.)
..* CFP outreach (primarily to local organizations promoting UR’d groups, @callbackwomen etc)
..* Local conference committees tasked with creating diverse line-up for keynotes, invited talks
..* Local conference committees tasked with making sure their membership and review committee is diverse
..* Local workshops for high school girls on how to code/intro to data science

4. Discussion: What do we mean when we say “diversity?”

Jennifer: OSS & Coding community is pretty homogenous, so any expansion of people who haven’t been traditionally well-represented. ..
Kari: What do we mean by events? (Gina: Moore Found. wants to distribute to all their communities for diverse & inclusive events)..
Erica: Different OS communities have different norms & people from different backgrounds. E.g. career-changers, women of color, etc...
Jennifer: Bringing people from broader academic prep backgrounds into coding & data science. ..
Manuel: Community has an opportunity to make it obvious to others that you can do computing almost anywhere in the world... Resources you have to start with shouldn’t be a reason to keep you from the community. E.g. lower socio-economic status communities..
Erica: Yes, that’s part of the reason we do Open Source (reduces costs, barriers to access)..
Manuel: Data availability across many domains. E.g. rich biomedical or social network data..
Reshama: How do we measure diversity? Do we have statistics for NF conferences? Increasing diversity at conferences or the general scientific community or going to the pipeline?..
Gina: Diversity on the basis of typical privilege/oppression dynamics (socio-economic, dis/ability, race, gender, sexual identity, etc.) Also challenge of even collecting data in a responsible way...
Erica (?): Make sure we’re making connections/relationships with conferences and events to support our testing efforts...
Erica: What does research mean? Does it mean we have a model of what the barriers are and the channels causing those barriers? Can imagine collecting data, summary statistics, theoretical model, etc...
Gina: We could conduct research at different degrees of rigor...
Erica: Research for Year 1 focus should be data collection. Can we generate summary statistics and a menu of different barriers based on what we’ve observed. Could we run our own survey (e.g. at PyData)? Ask about not just who they are but also about participation in OS Community, more free-form responses, inquire about barriers faced, etc. Esp. w/ability to compare similarly-run conferences in different places...
Gina: Yes, we can put PyData resources and data-collection possibilities behind this effort...
Reshama: re first year = data collection; have almost a prospectus study where one PyData city (e.g. NYC) could have certain methods that are less conventional. Example if the goal is 50% women, reach out to various communities of women and asking them to participate and submit proposals. 2nd: Whole process of submitting to conferences is very well outline on e.g. O’Reilly page, but maybe for underrepresented folks the process needs to be different. Maybe the process needs to be different to attract more diverse participants. 3rd: Could do it for one city and not another to measure impact: invite a woman you’d like to see speak, participate, attend (to male participants) and see what results...
Erica: Does anyone have exp. running experiments?..
Reshama: Has run clinical trials...
Gina: Has done qualitative research, could lend that to analyzing PyData survey...
Reshama: Can think of two people we could interview. CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap — was shown at Meetup headquarters; some of the engineers in the film work there. Have been able to hire a lot more female engineers. Read blog on founder of Meetup’s efforts to diversify company. Also knows data scientist at H20 in SF; if you really want to hire more women, it has to be a priority and can work. ..
Gina: Has resources/list to contribute to the survey of available research; Igor (not present) hopefully can also help re: barriers to OS participation...
Reshama comments to chat window:..
Here's the blog:..

We can also identify Men Who are "Advocates of Women"..
Reshama: Once we define “diversity” for the group, perhaps start with one group and try to increase for that group, or aim at all groups? Define some strategy for that...
Erica:  What do you mean by group?..
Reshama: Gender, race, sexual identity, whether we want to try for all at once or start with one and expand it to other groups, etc...

* How to collaborate?
..* Shared google docs (hosted @ NF)
..* Slack for conversation and ideas (NF can host it)

* What are next steps?
..* Gina will add members to Slack
..* Gina will create Google Doc with roadmap, Google Doc for PyData survey + experiments
..* Gina will create Google Doc for list of existing research, resources
..* Establish near-term task list, ask everyone to self-sign up on what they want to contribute to



**Proposed Roadmap, Year 1:**
* April-June 
..1 Compile and collate relevant research and existing data on diversity in open source and scientific computing communities
..* Include assessment of current/past NF initiatives
...* Post to GitHub?
..2 Summarize barriers to collection of accurate data (Gina will give a talk on this subject at PyData Seattle)
* July-September
..1 Analyze research + data to identify barriers to full participation, gaps in research
..2 Formulate strategy to tackle barriers to collection of accurate data
* October-December
..1 Conduct research to fill any major gaps in understanding participation, barriers to participation
..2 Develop initial list of best practices (proven and/or untested)
..3 Devise rollout method for testing best practices
...* Ensure we are communicating with conferences available for that.
* January-March
..1 Conduct best practices test(s)
...* Collect & analyze results
..2 Revise best practices list as-needed
..3 Publish summary of research and findings
